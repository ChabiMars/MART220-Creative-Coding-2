I decided to not use generative AI for any of my assets in this project. For the purposes of this assignment, I think that generative AI wouldn't be superior to just finding a copyright free image on google. Using AI to make an asset would be a waste in my opinion, especially if I had chosen to draw my assets. If I was someone in a situation where I lacked the ability to draw my own assets, and I couldn't use any sources off of google, I can see why someone might use generative AI to make an asset for them. However, personally I think that it's important to value the humanity in the piece of art in your code (the asset) and this would entail having it be man made. To me, assets created by a person, even if it looks "bad", has more life to it than something generated. If I were to generate an asset, there are also environmental concerns to take into account. Using AI for a small asset of a carrot would be a waste because of the fact that I can find a better looking image just through google without unnecessarily using water.
If I had used generative AI for my assets, I think that they would be pretty generic and polished, which isn't what was most important to me while making this game.
